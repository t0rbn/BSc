\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Motivation}
Project driven organisations have to face the problem of constantly needing to put teams together based on the members’ skills, experience and preferences.
In many businesses, there is no sophisticated source of information about those data which makes finding the right person with a specific ability even more complicated. A popular approach to this problem is using computer programs to find the right person for a given set of tasks from all availble employees.

SinnerSchrader, a hamburg based web agency that will serve as the practical context for this thesis, decided to launch an internal application for skills management that is meant to solve the aforesaid problems. This thesis will deal with the design and implementation of this software.



\subsection{SinnerSchrader}

The SinnerSchrader Group is a full service web agency based in Hamburg aggregating the subcompanies SinnerSchrader Deutschland, SinnerSchrader Content, SinnerSchrader Commerce and SinnerSchrader Swipe. The broad spectrum of expertise,including, but not limited to, digital communication strategies, visual and interaction design,  technical architecture, full stack development, editorial services, content production, E-Commerce, mobile app development, hosting, and maintenance, allows SinnerSchrader to serve all needs regarding their customer’s digital transformation. The combination of all said competencies under one single roof reduces organisational friction between the discipline-specific teams because they all share the same vision of the big picture they are creating. This does not only lead to faster development cycles, but also to a more coherent and unified product.

\subsubsection{Project-Driven Business}
As a web agency, it is clear that SinnerSchrader has to operate in a project-driven way. This means there no continuous stream of recurring work repeating constantly, but many different projects for different clients, each one dealing with varying challenges and questions. From a technical point of view, the diversity of know-how needed for each project is extremely huge since every application uses its own dedicated stack of technologies. As a consequence, the developers’ skill sets are based on the combination of projects they have worked on and their general field of interest. This results in one problem: Managers frequently have to put teams together based on the members’ skills with respect to the individual requirements of the project.\newline
This thesis will cover the creation of a tool helping managers with that problem by providing a centralized source of data about each employee’s professional abilities.

\subsubsection{Matrix Organisation}
The personnel of SinnerSchrader are divided into two different kinds of teams: functional teams of
employees sharing the same specialization, i.E. backend development, frontend development, design, or concept, and project teams of people from different functional teams working collaboratively on the same project. This structural model is called a matrix organisation. \cite[P. 75]{BWL}
The organisational head of functional teams will further be called the `supervisor'; the pendant for project team will be mentioned as `team manager'.

\section{Leading Goals}
This thesis will discuss the requirements a skills management will have to fulfill in order to be advantageous to SinnerSchrader. Existing solutions will be examined and evaluated regarding those requirements. The outcome of this analysis will lay the foundations for the design and concept of a skills management web application custom-tailored to SinnerSchrader's individual needs. The Backend part of said application will be implemented and evaluated.
