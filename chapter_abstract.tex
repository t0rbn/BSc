\chapter{Abstract}
Project driven organizations have to face the problem of constantly needing to put teams together based on the members’ skills, experience, motivation and preferences. At SinnerSchrader, like in many businesses, there is no central source of information about this data. Commercial solutions only take into account the employee’s knowledge whereas motivation and preferences will be ignored.
This thesis covers the design and partial implementation of a web application that provides a search function to find the most suitable employee for a searched skill set based not only on their skills but also on their motivation.
Usage scenarios and requirements that should be fulfilled by the system will be outlined. The design and realization of the application’s backend based on those requirements will be drafted and evaluated. To validate that the scoring algorithm created for this application is capable of fulfilling the users’ needs, a survey will be conducted and interpreted.
