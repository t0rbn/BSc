\chapter{Abstract}
TODO rewrite
% Project driven organisations have to face the problem of constantly needing to put teams together based on the members’ skills, experience and preferences. In many businesses, there is no sophisticated source of information about those data which makes finding the right person with a specific ability even more complicated.
% A central tool keeping track of all employees’ competencies and important metadata such as soft skills would come in handy.
% As part of this thesis, a prototype of a web application fulfilling sinnerschrader’s individual needs regarding will be contrived and partly implemented. The process of analysing those specific requirements with respect to the end users’ needs and designing a technical architecture capable of fulfilling them will be documented. Furthermore, the backend part of said application will be implemented using state-of-the-art web technologies. It’s internal structure will be explained and substantiated. The frontend components will also be implemented, but this will happen independently from the backend and thus cannot be part of this thesis.
