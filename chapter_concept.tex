\chapter{Concept}
The application should be accessible to all employees of SinnerSchrader. Due to the heterogeneity of the people’s computer setups running Windows, macOS and Linux, creating a native application supported by everyone’s system is a rather complicated task. A web application using standard technologies does not only solve this problem, but can also be used from mobile devices such as smart phones and tablets. Furthermore, there is no need to manually install and update the software so that it can be assumed that all users use the latest version of the application. This is not only a positive factor regarding the overall usability of the system, but also assures bugs and security issues are eliminated the moment a fixed version of the software is deployed. All those advantages compared to native clients and the fact that SinnerSchrader’s expertise lies in the development of web applications made the decision that this tool should be realized as such. (TODO: wording as such)
