\chapter{Abstract}
Nowadays, working environments do not present workers with a continuous stream of recurring tasks like at the assembly line. Instead, highly skilled employees with diverse competencies work in dynamic teams to complete nonrepeating projects.
As a consequence, project driven organizations face the problem of constantly needing to put teams together based on the members’ skills, experience, motivation and personal preferences. At SinnerSchrader, like in many businesses, there is no central source of information about this data.
This thesis covers the design and partial implementation of a web application custom-tailored to SinnerSchrader that provides a simple way to manage employees' skills and interests using a novel approach of integrating a rating based information retrieval system. It will rank employees not only by their knowledge but also by their motivation to find the most suitable employee for the user's search query.
To validate that the application, and especially the novel scoring approach, is capable of fulfilling the users’ needs, a survey has been conducted and interpreted. The backend implementation has been tested regarding both functional and non-functional requirements.
