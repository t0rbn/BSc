abstract = { Purpose – In this paper, the aim is to present an algorithm to identify the most motivated employees according to the corporate human resources policies applied in a knowledge‐based company.Design/methodology/approach – First, the author presents a complete table with motivation factors found in the literature. Then, a fuzzy tool, i.e. an adequacy index, is used in order to include subjectivity and uncertainty from personal perceptions both from employees and managers in the model.Findings – An algorithm to identify the most motivated employees according to corporate motivation policies designed by managers is found.Practical implications – Results provide information that can be used as a support for helping managers in decision making about training, promotion, leadership practices or team management.Originality/value – An exhaustive list that does not exist in the literature about motivation factors is presented as well as the proposal of measure and identification on most‐motivated employees is also a new idea. }

abstract = "Abstract On the Internet, where the number of choices is overwhelming, there is need to filter, prioritize and efficiently deliver relevant information in order to alleviate the problem of information overload, which has created a potential problem to many Internet users. Recommender systems solve this problem by searching through large volume of dynamically generated information to provide users with personalized content and services. This paper explores the different characteristics and potentials of different prediction techniques in recommendation systems in order to serve as a compass for research and practice in the field of recommendation systems.

abstract = "Intrinsic and extrinsic types of motivation have been widely studied, and the distinction between them has shed important light on both developmental and educational practices. In this review we revisit the classic definitions of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation in light of contemporary research and theory. Intrinsic motivation remains an important construct, reflecting the natural human propensity to learn and assimilate. However, extrinsic motivation is argued to vary considerably in its relative autonomy and thus can either reflect external control or true self-regulation. The relations of both classes of motives to basic human needs for autonomy, competence and relatedness are discussed."
