multiple Web services
	is a fundamental characteristic of the technology.
However, without
	sufficient infrastructure support services, composite
applications
	must rely on proprietary solutions to ensure correct
operation. Applications
	typically use multiple Web services in combination
to solve specific
	business problems such as processing an order,
updating multiple

scheduling just

	ensuring business processes achieve predictable results
and recovery

called context,
	is essential for the proper operation of applications
composed of

as part of
	a composite application and allows each Web service to
share information

database connections.
	Extensions to basic context operations provide
the ability to support

process automations and

spanning multiple models,

  note = {\url{http://developers.sun.com/techtopics/webservices/wscaf/wscf.pdf}},
  abstract = {Coordination is a requirement present in a
variety of different aspects
	of distributed applications. For instance,
workflow, atomic transactions,
	caching and replication, security,
auctioning, and business-tobusiness
	activities all require some level of
what may be collectively referred
	to as ?coordination.? For example,
coordination of multiple Web services
	in choreography may be required
to ensure the correct result of a
	series of operations comprising
a single business transaction. Whenever
	coordination occurs, the
propagation of additional information (the
	coordination context) to
coordinated participants is required. The
	coordination context contains
information such as a unique ID that
	allows a series of operations to
share a common outcome. The outcome
	is typically defined in terms
of coordinated state persistence operations.
	For example, in a Web
services-based architecture, a SOAP header
	block might contain context
information that is propagated when interacting
	with a coordinator, or when
multiple participants exchange SOAP messages
	in order to create a larger
interaction such as a process flow or
	other aggregation of services. A
Web services coordinator maintains
	a repository of participants and
ensures that each participant receives
	a result of the coordinated
interaction. A coordinator can also be
	a participant, creating a tree
of sub-coordinators or peer-coordinators
	that cooperate to further
propagate the result. When one of the participants
	generates a fault,
for example, the coordinator ensures that all
	other participants
are notified. A Web services coordinator sends
	and receives SOAP
encoded messages for interoperability with any
	type of participant,
regardless of operating system, programming
	language, or platform. Context
information flows as SOAP header blocks
	with application messages sent to
participants/endpoints. The important
	point is that this information is specific
to the type of coordination
	being performed, e.g., to identify the
coordinator(s), the other
	participants, recovery information in the event of
a failure, etc.
	Coordination is a fundamental requirement of many
distributed systems,
	including Web Services. However, the type of
coordination protocol
	that is used may vary depending upon the circumstances
(e.g., two-phase
	versus three-phase). Therefore, what is needed is a
standardization
	on a coordination framework (coordination service)
that allows users
	and services to register with it, and customize
it on a per service
	or per application basis. Such a coordination
service would also
	support newly emerging Web service standards such as

  abstract = {The ability to scope arbitrary units of work is a requirement in a
variety
	of aspects of distributed applications such as workflow and
business-to-business
	interactions. By scoping work, we mean that it is possible for
business
	activity participants to be able to determine unambiguously
whether
	or not they are participating in the same activity. In order to
correlate
	the work of participants within the same activity, it is
necessary
	to propagate additional information know as the context to
each participant.
	The context contains information (such as a unique
identifier) that
	allows a series of operations to share a common
outcome. For example,
	in a Web services-based application, a SOAP header
block might contain
	contextual information that is propagated when
invoking an operation
	on a Web Service, or when multiple participants
exchange SOAP messages
	in order to create a larger interaction such as a
process flow. A
	Web Services Context Service maintains a repository
of context information
	and tracks contexts shared between multiple
participants in Web services
	interactions. An Context Service can also be a
participant within
	an activity, creating a tree to further propagate the
context. A
	Web Services Context Service accepts and emits SOAP messages
for
	interoperability with any type of participant, regardless of
operating
	system, programming language, or platform ? and is independent
of
	underlying transfer or transport protocols. Context is always
propagated
	in addition to application payload, where context information
travels
	within the SOAP header blocks while application payload (that
is,
	the content intended for processing by a SOAP node playing the
ultimateReceiver
	role) is propagated inside the SOAP body. The context
information
	is specific to the type of activity being performed, such as to
identify
	a transaction coordinator, the other participants in an
activity,
	or recovery information in the event of a failure, etc.
Therefore,
	a single context type is not sufficient for all types of
activity
	that a Context Service may be required to support. Hence, the
capabilities
	of the Context Service must be extensible in an application
specific
	manner and services must be able to augment the context as
they require
	to suit their own particular application domains. Given
the importance
	of context propagation in many distributed systems,
including Web
	Services, standardization on a context framework (Context
Service)
	is a logical progression in increasing the usefulness and
robustness
	of the Web Services architecture. That is, there is a distinct
requirement
	for a generic context propagation service that allows users and
services
	to register with it, and customize it on a per-service or
per-application
	basis. This service also supports newly emerging Web
Service standards
	such as coordination, workflow and transactions.},

  abstract = {An increasing number of applications
are being constructed by combining
	or coordinating the execution of
multiple Web services, each of which
	may represent an interface to
a different underlying technology.
	The resulting applications can
be very complex in structure, with
	complex relationships between
their constituent services. Furthermore,
	the execution of such an
application may take a long time to complete,
	and may contain long
periods of inactivity, often due to the constituent
	services requiring
user interactions. In the loosely coupled environment
	represented by
Web services, long running applications will require
	support for
recovery and compensation, because machines may fail,
	processes may
be cancelled, or services may be moved or withdrawn.
	Web services
transactions also must span multiple transaction models
	and protocols
native to the underlying technologies onto which the
	Web services are
mapped. A common technique for fault-tolerance is
	through the use
of atomic transactions, which have the well know
	ACID properties,
operating on persistent (long-lived) objects. Transactions
	ensure
that only consistent state changes take place despite concurrent
access
	and failures. However, traditional transactions depend upon
tightly
	coupled protocols, and thus are often not well suited to more
loosely-coupled
	Web services based applications, although they are likely to be
used
	in some of the constituent technologies. It is more likely that
traditional
	transactions are used in the minority of cases in which
the cooperating
	Web services can take advantage of them, while new
mechanisms, such
	as compensation, replay, and persisting business process
state, more
	suited to Web services are developed and used for the more
typical
	case. WS-TXN provides a suite of transaction models, each
suited
	to solving a different problem domain. However, because WS-TXN
leverages
	WS-CF, it is intended to allow flexibility in the types of
models
	supported. Therefore, if new models are required for other
problem
	areas, they can be incorporated within this specification.},

  abstract = {Data Grids [DATA] are distributed environments where applications
	access, manage
and distribute data and events in a timely fashion
	at a very large
scale and potentially across organizational boundaries.
	Challenges
arise from the size of the data, the geographical distance,
	and the
number of involved parties (such publishers and consumers).
	Data
Grids need to protect the critical data (security, authorization,
auditing,
	etc.) and need to guarantee transparent and efficient access
to and
	distribution of data with the required Quality Of Service
(QOS).
	?Grid Data Distribution? - here after known as (GDD) model
- answers
	these requirements. The GDD model supports dynamic and
efficient
	data distribution of customized information mainly based on
consumer?s
	needs. The outline of the paper is as follows. First we
provide a
	definition of the GDD components. Second we position GDD
functionality
	with respect to Grid Data Access and Notification.
Then we describe
	in detail the operations that are introduced to
support the new functionality,
	which are defined as extensions of the
existing Data Access specifications
	and we describe the use case
scenarios of GDD for Data Replication
	and 3rd party Data delivery.
Finally, we outline the remaining work
	and open issues in this area.},

transactional

over
	the next decade by using Grid-enabled Web services to integrate
across
	the Internet to share not only applications, but also computer
power.
	This article introduces developers to the basic idea of Grid
computing
	and the Open Grid Services Architecture (OGSA). Developers can
use
	the latest Globus Toolkit (Open Grid Services Infrastructure
technology
	preview) to discover a Grid service, create a Grid service
interface,
	and invoke a Grid service instance. Some ideas to help
developers
	integrate Web services and Grid computing are also described.},
