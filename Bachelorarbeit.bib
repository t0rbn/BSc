abstract = { Purpose – In this paper, the aim is to present an algorithm to identify the most motivated employees according to the corporate human resources policies applied in a knowledge‐based company.Design/methodology/approach – First, the author presents a complete table with motivation factors found in the literature. Then, a fuzzy tool, i.e. an adequacy index, is used in order to include subjectivity and uncertainty from personal perceptions both from employees and managers in the model.Findings – An algorithm to identify the most motivated employees according to corporate motivation policies designed by managers is found.Practical implications – Results provide information that can be used as a support for helping managers in decision making about training, promotion, leadership practices or team management.Originality/value – An exhaustive list that does not exist in the literature about motivation factors is presented as well as the proposal of measure and identification on most‐motivated employees is also a new idea. }
